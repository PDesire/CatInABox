*“Do you know someone you would trust to carry a cat in a box?”*

## Inspiration

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a sharp increase in demand for delivery services. Companies are buying new vans to meet the increased demand – but many already existing vehicles are not yet fully loaded.    
We solve the problem of increasing demand for delivery in general and for urban-rural exchange in particular:   
**Motivated drivers or commuters publish their unused transport capacities through our system for a more sustainable way of delivery services from A to B.**

## Idea

🚗 You are a driver or commuter and still have transport capacities to take a **cat in a box*** for someone in need?  
**Publish your ride and get kudos!**

🐈 You can’t bring your mother’s **cat in a box*** back to her house because of Corona and need someone to bring?   
**Find your ride and make someone happy!**

**or any other object of similar size, weight and emotional value*
